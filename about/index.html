A little intro of myself...

I am a happy husband, father of two, from Malta, a small island in the Mediterranean Sea.

I have been in the IT industry since 1993 after graduating from the University of Malta.

Presently I am doing a Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence on a part-time tuition and research basis. My current area of research is portfolio optimization using nature-inspire metaheuristic techniques.
