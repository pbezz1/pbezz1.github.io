<p>A little intro of myself... </p>

<p>I am a happy husband and father of two, working and living in Malta, a small island in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>I have been in the IT industry since graduating in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Malta back in 1993.</p>

<p>Presently I am doing a Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence on a part-time tuition and research basis. My current area of research is portfolio optimization using nature-inspire metaheuristic techniques.</p>
